This project was an opportunity for me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Its primary goal was to replicate a given design, allowing me to practice and refine my proficiency in these technologies.

To ensure a responsive user experience, I leveraged the power of Bootstrap. By incorporating its responsive grid system and components, I successfully made the web page adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

In summary, this project served as a practical exercise in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, enabling me to further develop my abilities and achieve the desired design replication.
